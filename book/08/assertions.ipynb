    "## Assertions\n",
    "The main purpose of *assertions* is to catch logical errors: we need checks that verify that our code is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions can be defined by the keyword `assert`. They take an expression that evaluates to a boolean and if its value is `False`, then an `AssertionError` is raised. We can set a message for the raised exception by providing it in the assertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of assertion statements `assert <condition>, <message>` as equivalent to:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not condition:\n",
    "  raise AssertionError(message)\n",

    "Assertions are very useful for *unit testing* your code. A *unit* can be seen as the smallest piece of code that can be individually tested. In our case, this would mean testing a Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is advisable to make one or multiple test functions that test your code and run those functions every time you make a modification to the *codebase* (i.e., all the code you develop). This can ensure that any new modifications to the existing code do not damage the previous functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find a few examples using the function from [the Raising and Handling Errors page](./errors_raise_handle.ipynb), where we have correct assertions. Therefore, no exception is occurring. Note that setting a message is not mandatory, but highly recommended for debugging purposes:"
