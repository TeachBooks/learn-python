    "The main purpose of *assertions* is to catch logical errors: we need checks that verify that our code is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions can be defined by the keyword `assert`. They take an expression that evaluates to a boolean and if its value is `False`, then an `AssertionError` is raised. We can set a message for the raised exception by providing it in the assertion.\n",

    "It is advisable to make one or multiple test functions that test your code and run those functions every time you make a modification to the *codebase* (i.e., all the code you develop). This can ensure that any new modifications to the existing code do not damage the previous functionalities.\n",
