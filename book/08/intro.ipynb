    "This chapter is focused on software testing with Python---it focuses on a number of different topics to help you identify and fix errors.

    "**Why should we learn about software testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing our code is necessary, because we as humans all make mistakes. Some of our mistakes may not be that important, but some can be dangeours and harmful. There are numerous examples of the latter such as the explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket or the problem with NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter. You can read more on these examples [here](https://medium.com/swlh/some-of-the-most-famous-bugs-in-software-history-bb16a2ee3f8e). Testing our code for hidden flaws is the first step towards ensuring that the programs we write are robust.\n",

    "Exceptions is a general set of errors that, unlike syntax errors, appear during code execution. If an exception stops your code from running, we often refer to this as _raising an exception._ Many exceptions are implemented directly in the Python code base, but it is important to recognize that anyone writing Python code can create exceptions themselves. Determining how and when to _raise_ exceptions (i.e., \"cause\" the error) during code execution is a useful way to make sure code and software runs as designed; we will learn to do this later. For now we will look at several examples of exceptions that are implemented in the Python code base:"

    "As you see in the examples above, we have encountered 3 different types of exceptions - `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError` and `NameError`. A nice thing about Python is that it tells us the specific type of exception we are dealing it, making it easy for you, the developer, to figure out the cause of the raised exceptions. Although in some cases the cause of the exception is obvious, it is often useful to look up the [Python documentation that describes it](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) (especially when your code gets complex, and you are having trouble identifying the source of the problem). For example, if you look at the description of [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError), you will find:\n",

    "The assertion above fails due to the fact that we are dealing with floating point numbers. For example, we might be using `0.3` in our calculations, but in practice, `0.30004` could be used instead due to the way floating point numbers are stored in memory.
