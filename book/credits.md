Note that this book draws heavily on the content of ["Think Python 2nd Edition" by Allen B.

## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a Jupyter Book that uses a number of features from [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) and is written using Markdown, Jupyter notebooks and Python files to generate some figures. The source files are stored on a public GitHub repository [github.com/TUDelft-books/learn-python](https://github.com/TUDelft-books/learn-python). Zenodo is used to archive all open versions of the book (beginning with the 2025-26 academic year) and to provide a DOI ([10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxx](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxx)).  View the repository README file or contact the editors for additional and up-to-date information.

## Acknowledgements

Financial support for this project was provided through an open education grant from the Educational Management Team for the Civil Engineering and Geosciences Faculty at Delft. The content was first developed for Summer 2022 by Sandra Verhagen and a team of TA's in Jupyter notebooks that were auto-graded in Vocareum (Guilherme Ferreira Sêco de Alvarenga, Arsenijs Nitijevskis and Jarno Vegting). For Summer 2023 a second round of funding was optained to update the content and adapt it to an entirely open and self-paced course without enrollement via a Jupyter Book, led by Robert Lanzafame. Special thanks goes to Miguel Mendoza Lugo who adapted the notebooks into the Jupyter Book format and implemented the interactive features, as well as Ahmed Farahat, who helped create the fun new visual features that make understanding the material easier in the Jupyter Book platform, as well as the In a Nutshell summaries. Guilherme Ferreira Sêco de Alvarenga made improvements to the content and set up the interactive Python feature via [TeachBooks](teachbooks.io) tools. In late 2024 and 2025, Shiya Tang improved the contents and converted exercises from JupyterQuiz to H5p.
