## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a Jupyter Book that uses a number of features from [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) and is written using Markdown, Jupyter notebooks and Python files to generate some figures. The source files are stored on a public GitHub repository [github.com/teachbooks/learn-python](https://github.com/teachbooks/learn-python). Zenodo is used to archive all open versions of the book (beginning with the 2024-25 academic year) and to provide a DOI ([10.5281/zenodo.16236358](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16236358)).  View the repository README file or contact the editors for additional and up-to-date information.
