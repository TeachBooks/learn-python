    "# Working with files\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the work you'll do in Python will have the following structure:\n",
    "1. Read data from a file\n",
    "2. Perform computations on the data\n",
    "3. Visualize the results and/or save the results to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only learned about computations. So let's learn a bit about how to manage files. Actually, opening or saving files is usually done with the help of modules which you will learn in more detail in Notebook 4 and 6. What we'll discuss here is how to manage file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File paths\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn how to use files we need to learn how file paths in computers work. If you are tech-savvy and know how file paths work you can skip this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "File paths in computers work like a tree. They start at the <b>root</b> directory, which is often the <b><code>C:</code></b> drive (in Windows). This is the name of the hard drive that stores your Operating System. From the <b><code>C:</code></b> drive you can navigate into other directories. This is done using the **``\\``** character, however in other Operating Systems often the <b><code>/</code></b> delimiter is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file is in the folder <b><code>Users</code></b>, which is stored in the <b><code>C:</code></b> directory, the file path would be <b><code>C:\\Users</code></b>. These types of file paths are called <b>absolute paths</b>. This file path is valid for most computers that run Windows, but some other Operating Systems may have different folder setups. This is why it is useful to use <b>relative paths</b>. Relative paths do not start from the root directory. Instead, they start from the directory you are currently in. By default, Jupyter Notebooks are stored in <b><code>C:\\Users\\CurrentUser</code></b> (where <b><code>CurrentUser</code></b> is your Windows username). To move into a directory using a relative path, for example, to the desktop folder, you would just write <b><code>.\\Desktop</code></b>. To move back a directory, using a relative path, you would type <b><code>..</code></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "`os.listdir()` or `os.listdir('./')` list all the entries in your current directory `os.listdir('../')` list all entries if we go back one level. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "We use the `/` as delimiter, since a `\\` won't work on macOS\n",
