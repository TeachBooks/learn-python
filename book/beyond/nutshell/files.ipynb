    "### File paths\n",
    "File paths on computers work based on a hierarchical structure, often represented as a tree. The root directory serves as the starting point, typically represented by a drive letter (e.g., C: on Windows). From the root directory, you can navigate to other directories using a delimiter character (\\ on Windows or / on Unix-based systems). Each directory can contain files and subdirectories, forming a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute paths specify the complete path from the root directory, while relative paths are relative to the current working directory. By understanding and manipulating file paths, you can effectively locate and access files and directories on a computer's file system."

    "### ``pathlib`` and <code>os</code> modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>os</code> module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system, offering operations related to file management, directory handling, process management, and environment variables. It allows you to perform tasks such as creating, deleting, and modifying files and directories, launching external processes, accessing and modifying environment variables, and writing platform-independent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the <code>pathlib</code> module introduced in Python 3.4 offers an object-oriented approach to working with file paths and directories. It provides the Path class, which represents paths as objects, allowing for more intuitive and expressive manipulation of paths compared to the traditional string-based operations in <code>os</code>. With <code>pathlib</code>, you can perform operations like joining paths, checking file existence, accessing file attributes, and creating directories in a more convenient and readable manner.\n",
