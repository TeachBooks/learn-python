This repository contains the source for the website [Python for Engineers](https://oit.tudelft.nl/learn-python/). The website is a self-paced online course, which is meant to be a way to provide (and refresh) knowledge of Python. This course was originally developed for students in the fields of: Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Applied Earth Sciences and Construction Management and Engineering. These programs are part of the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. We try to draw on examples from these fields, but the course contents should be relevant for any engineering or applied geoscience discipline.

## Course Overview

The course "Learn Python for Engineers" aims to provide freshman master students with essential Python programming skills tailored to their field of study. By the end of the course, students will:

1. Gain a solid foundation in Python programming.
2. Understand how Python can be applied in engineering and geoscience.
3. Develop the ability to automate tasks and analyze complex data using Python.
4. Acquire skills to visualize information effectively.
5. Learn to develop efficient algorithms for problem-solving in their domain.
6. Enhance their academic performance and future professional prospects.
7. Become part of a vibrant learning community and foster collaboration with fellow classmates.

## Acknowledgments

Financial support for this project was provided through an open education grant from the Educational Management Team for the Civil Engineering and Geosciences Faculty at Delft. The content was first developed for Summer 2022 by Sandra Verhagen and a team of TA's in Jupyter notebooks that were auto-graded in Vocareum (Guilherme Ferreira Sêco de Alvarenga, Arsenijs Nitijevskis and Jarno Vegting). For Summer 2023 a second round of funding was optained to update the content and adapt it to an entirely open and self-paced course without enrollement via a Jupyter Book, led by Robert Lanzafame. Special thanks goes to Miguel Mendoza Lugo who adapted the notebooks into the Jupyter Book format and implemented the interactive features, as well as Ahmed Farahat, who helped create the fun new visual features that make understanding the material easier in the Jupyter Book platform, as well as the In a Nutshell summaries. Guilherme Ferreira Sêco de Alvarenga made improvements to the content and set up the interactive Python feature via [TeachBooks](teachbooks.io) tools. In late 2024 and 2025, Shiya Tang improved the contents and converted exercises from JupyterQuiz to H5p.

This Book is maintained and developed by staff of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences of TU Delft, the Netherlands. If you have questions or suggestions, get in touch via a GitHub Issue or by email at MUDE-CEG@tudelft.nl.

## Technical Details

This book is created using open source tools: it is a Jupyter Book that uses a number of features from [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) and is written using Markdown, Jupyter notebooks and Python files to generate some figures. See the Credits page for additional information.

Starting with the 2025-26 academic year, the book uses semantic versioning of form `vA.B.C`, where `A` is the major version as an academic year (e.g., 2025), `B` is the minor version and `C` is the patch version. The major version updates will not necessarily occur every year; for example, in 2027 we may still be on version `v2025.7.x`.

Also beginning with the 2025-26 academic year, the TeachBooks Deploy Book Workflow is used to redirect users to the major version of the book in use, with branches being named accordingly (e.g., `2024` and `2025`). When a new major version is released, the default branch in GitHub should also be updated, reflecting the current major version.
