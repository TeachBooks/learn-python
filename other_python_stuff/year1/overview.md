# Overview of Activities

Coding in MUDE was predominantly organized by dedicated workshops at least once per week in Q1, with fewer workshops in Q2. The introduction week (Week 1) provided material for students to install Anaconda, and crash courses on `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

All notebooks set not to execute on build using `_dont_execute.ipynb`

The following topics were **not** transferred from the Archive into the book for 2023-24:
- Software Installations (in Week 1.1 Chapter)
- FAIR principles (slides and video links)
