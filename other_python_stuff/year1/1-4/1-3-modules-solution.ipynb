    "Programming tasks usually require writing several lines of code which are much better organized in a **modular** fashion, rather than in single, extremely long Jupyter notebooks (or .py script files). Modularization refers to splitting such large programming tasks into smaller, separate, and more manageable subtasks. Python scripts are modularized through **functions**, **classes**, **modules**, and **packages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you should be already familiar with *functions* and *classes*, you should think  of *modules* as a `.py` files containing Python functions, classes, definitions and statements. On the other hand, a package is a set of modules,  i.e., a collection of `.py` files organized in folders and subfolders. Python accesses the modules in a package by referencing the package name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity has the added advantage of isolating your code blocks into files that can be used in any number of different programs. Futhermore, if you want to extend their functionality, you would not need to modify multiple files, but only the file they reside in.\n",

    "You have been using Pyhon modularization all along, maybe without even realizing it.\n",
