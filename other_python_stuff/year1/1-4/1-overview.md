# Debugging, Testing, Object-Oriented Programming, Modules

This week's Python coding workshop is divided in three parts [in brackets the estimated time without optional material]:

1. Debugging and Testing [~1hour]
2. Object-Oriented Programming [~2hours]
3. Modules [~30 minutes]

You are supposed to do the three tutorials in the order displayed above. Download each part in your local laptop in a separate folder, or use JupyterHub.

If you need to catch-up with previous material, or if you are still struggling with Python, the following simplified workshop is recommended:

1. Debugging and Testing
    
    <span style="color:darkred">Do the entire notebook apart from sections, paragraphs and exercises marked as optional.</span>

1. Object-Oriented Programming

    <span style="color:darkred">Do only until the topic "Refining the Rocket class".</span>

1. Modules

    <span style="color:darkred">Do until the section "Optional Material".</span>
