    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable blocks of code called *classes*, which bundle data (*attributes*) and behaviors (*methods*) together.\n",
    "When you want to use a class in one of your programs, you make an **object** from that class, which is where the phrase \"object-oriented\" comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP promotes:\n",
    "- modularity: making multiple modules or functions and then combining them to form a complete system\n",
    "- reusability: shared attributes and functions can be reused without the need of rewriting code\n",
    "- better code organization: less code and more reuse\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "OOP is defined by 4 main concepts:\n",
    "- Encapsulation: concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. Its purpose is to help in organizing and protecting an object's internal state and behavior;\n",
    "- Inheritance: mechanism that allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. Its purpose is to promote code reusability, extensibility, and the creation of class hierarchies, where subclasses can build upon the functionality of their parent classes;\n",
    "- Polymorphism: ability of different objects to respond to the same method name in a way that is specific to their class. It simplifies code by enabling flexibility and dynamic behavior;\n",
    "- Abstraction: process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential properties. It reduces complexity, making code more understandable and maintainable. -->\n",

    "Classes can be thought of as blueprints or templates for creating objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a body of code that defines the **attributes** and **behaviors** required to accurately model something you need for your program. Each class encapsulates both properties (attributes) and functions (methods) related to that type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **attribute** is a piece of information. In code, an attribute is just a variable that is part of a class.\n",

    "Now let's examine how we created this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line, with the keyword **class**, tells Python that you are about to define a class. The naming convention for classes is the CamelCase, a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name. \n",
    "It is recommended that the class name does not have any parentheses after it, unless it inherits from another class (we'll see this better later).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to write a comment at the beginning of your class, describing the class. There is a [more formal syntax](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for documenting your classes, but you can wait a little bit to get that formal. For now, just write a comment at the beginning of your class summarizing what you intend the class to do. Writing more formal documentation for your classes will be easy later if you start by writing simple comments now.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first things you do when creating a class is to define the `__init__()` method. \n",
    "The `__init__()` method is called automatically when you create an object from your class and sets the values for any parameters that need to be defined when an object is first created. 0\n",
    "We call this method a ***constructor***. \n",
    "In this case, The `__init__()` method initializes the x and y values of the Rocket to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***self*** part is a syntax that allows you to access variables and methods from anywhere else in the class.\n",
    "The word \"self\" refers to the current object that you are working with. Basically, all methods in a class need the *self* object as their first argument, so they can access any attribute that is part of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods define a specific action that the class can do.\n",
    "A method is just a function that is part of a class. Since it is just a function, you can do anything with a method that you learned about with functions.\n",
    "Each method generally accepts at least one argument, the value **self**. This is a reference to the particular object that is calling the method."

This is beneficial as it enables engineers to write code that is easy to maintain. For example, if you add a new attribute or a method to a class, you will not need to update all your objects, but only the class itself.\n",

    "A nice feature that encapsulation provides is private attributes and private methods. Those are units, which are meant to only be used internally in a class and not accessed outside of it. By convention programmers should not access them via the object. Furthermore, in order to create a private attribute or a private method, you need to put 2 leading underscores (`_`) before their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the `__init__` method for an example. You are not supposed to call the method, as it is automatically called when you create a new object. Furthermore, note that it has 2 leading and 2 trailing underscores. This is meant to show that this method is resereved in Python. **Therefore, you should not make attributes or methods that have both leading and trailing underscores, because you may mess up how Python works**. Besides the `__init__` method, there are more built-in methods that start and end with 2 underscores. These are called **magic methods**, and determine the behaviour when certain operations (for example: +, - or `print()`) are performed on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the Rocket class below, which contains a private attribute `creation_date`. We will call this attribute `__creation_date` to tell Python that we want it to be private.

This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate.
