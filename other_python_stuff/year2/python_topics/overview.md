# Python Topics

This Chapter focuses on several generic programming topics applied using the Python language. You can think of them as "advanced" in the sense that they extend topics typically covered in a BSc programming course. If you are not comfortable with topics in this chapter we strongly encourage you to review relevant parts of the online course [Python for Engineers](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-python/intro.html).


Content will be added here throughout the semester. When special software is concerned, remember to check the [software page](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/overview/) on the module website for information related to installation.
