# Packages

Python only has some basic functionality

Standard packages

Need to do other stuff: add more!

This comes with a downside: keeping all of these packages up to date. The suite of packages together creates an **environment,** which is the subject of the next Section.


## Packages

**package** defined

there are many sources. common ones are PyPI and conda forge

We can also have local packages! we will learn about those later

### Installing Packages

How to install packages

Use conda. Always do it this way:

```{admonition} conda
code
```


A bit of a note about packages/modules and methods, with example of `matplotlib.pyplot` and a method.

```{note}
you may ave used pip install in the past, but it's not good practice since it can mess with your stuff...
```
