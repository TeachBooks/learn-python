# Computers & Code 

```{note}
The entire Code chapter was never shared in MUDE in 2023-2024.

There are some files in this directory that are not in the `toc` but contain a few notes and outlines.

```{note}
This page was not shared with MUDE students in 2023-2024 (year 2).

It may have been a new page, or a modified page from year 1.

There may be pages in year 1 and year 2 that are nearly identical, or have significant modifications. Modifications usually were to reformat the notebooks to fit in a jupyter book framework better.

text. Matlab also high level and multi-purpose like Python.

Things that will definitely go here:
- functions (a brief overview/highlight of features, then link to the object part of programs)
- complexity: where does it come from and why is it important (work backwards to know which concepts need to be included (e.g., bits and flops etc)); can find good reference rather than repeat chapters of numerical analysis textbook material

## Python language

There are some things included here, but we will need much more
