# Programs 

This part of the textbook covers aspects related to computer _programs_. We cover tools, for example, tools for writing programs effectively, for example, debugging, testing and git/GitLab. We may also cover methodological aspects such as modular programs and object-oriented programming.

<!-- MMMMM 2024: at end of Q1 2023 Robert abandoned the original 5-chapter plan for programming, but left the directory structure in place. a new chapter Python Topics was created. -->

Content will be added here throughout the semester. When special software is concerned, remember to check the [software page](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/overview/) of the module website for information related to installation.

<!-- text. Can briefly mention programming paradigms and that we focus on object-oriented and functional. FORTRAN was old standard in engineering, which is declarative. 

Things that will definitely go here:
- Objects
  - theory: what it is, why it's useful
  - Case studies: interactive pages that focus on variables, functions, figures as objects
- Modular programming workshop
  - importing py files
  - connection to how packages function (explore with interactive features)
- Writing efficient programs for numerical analysis
  - add theory missing from Code chapter
  - explicit case studies illustrating best practices
  - examples that quantitatively show the effect of bad practices
  - e.g., sparse matrices, for loops and why they should be avoided -->
