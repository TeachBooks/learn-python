    "Logging can be used for debugging. For example, you can have a program report at every step what it is calculating and print this information to the output. At first glance, logging may appear to be very similar to simply using `print` statements, but it comes with a lot of benefits. For example, it is possible to use timestamps with the messages you create and it is also possible to group messages by type. Furthermore, logging can let the user specify a file, where the logging information can be stored. This can be useful in case of an application crash to identify the cause of it by examining the logs.<br><br>\n",
    "The Python `logging` library supports 5 different types of messages:\n",
    "- `debug`: very detailed information used for localizing errors\n",
    "- `info`: confirmation that things are working as expected\n",
    "- `warning`: something unexpected happened, but the program will keep going\n",
    "- `error`: something has gone badly wrong, but the program hasnâ€™t hurt anything\n",
    "- `critical`: potential loss of data, security breach, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find below examples of all 5 types of messages, where the logs are printed in the output:"
