abstract: >-
  Python for Engineers is an interactive online textbook (website)
  that functions as
  a self-paced online course. It is meant to provide
  (and refresh) knowledge of the Python Programming language. The most recent version of the
  book can be found at https://oit.tudelft.nl/learn-python
  
  This course was originally
  developed for students in the fields of: Civil Engineering,
  Environmental Engineering, Applied Earth Sciences and Construction
  Management and Engineering. These programs are part of the faculty
  of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of
  Technology in the Netherlands. We try to draw on examples from
  these fields, but the course contents should be relevant for any
  engineering or applied geoscience discipline.
